export const aboutMe =
   "I am a Programming Enthusiast and an Industrial Engineering student from Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I've been introduced to the world of programming when I was in first year where we have a course entitled Basic Programming. By that time I really don't know what would be the essence of learning how to program, and I admit it that back then I am really not a fun of the subject. But when the lockdown starts to strikes, the curiosity of how to hack and track something led me to pursue programming. I've learned that there are many possible jobs that you can gain ifyou know how to program. and there are many tracks that you can choose. The thing that I don't care about back then, excites me now. The track that I chose first is web development. In the near future I want to pursue Data Science and Machine Learning. ";
