export const aboutMe =
   "I am a Programming Enthusiast and an Industrial Engineering student from Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I've been introduced to the world of programming when I was in first year where we have a course entitled Basic Programming. By that time I really don't know what would be the essence of learning how to program, and I admit that back then I am really not a fan of the subject. But when the lockdown starts to strike, the curiosity of how to hack and track something led me to pursue programming. I've learned that there are many possible jobs that you can gain if you know how to program and there are many areas that you can choose. I started to learn web development first hoping that I could gain entry from this area. In the near future I will pursue Data Science and Machine Learning.";
